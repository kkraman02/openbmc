Subject: [PATCH 08/13] Disable patching to IPv4Address when DHCP is enabled

In accordance with schema http://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/v1/
IPAddresses.json#/definitions/IPv4Address, some items in "IPv4Address"
schema should be read-only when DHCPv4 is enabled in the interface. This
commit disables patching to those items (Address, Gateway, SubnetMask)
when the "DHCPEnabled" property in "DHCPv4" is true. This also affects
when passing "DHCPEnabled" with true value together with "IPv4Address"
items in the same redfish patch command. "IPv4StaticAddresses"
implements the "IPv4Address" schema and is patch-able so should follow
the rule.

Tested:
When "DHCPEnabled" is true, patching to Address, Gateway or SubnetMask of
"IPv4Address" results in PropertyNotWritable error message.
